# R&D Project 2020-2021, Discord bot assisting in seminars
We will make a Discord bot that helps with the organisation of tutorials via Discord.
It is intended to ease the organisation for teachers and TAs and to streamline the process for students leading to fewer misunderstandings.
This results in much more time that the underfunded education system can put into students, instead of Discord.
